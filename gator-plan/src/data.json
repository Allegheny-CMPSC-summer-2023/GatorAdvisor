Exploring various industrial architectures, students develop devices that respond to physical stimuli and transmit data across networks to motivate additional device behavior and interactivity while considering human interaction design (HID) and “people-centered” principles that drive device design. During weekly laboratory sessions, students complete projects which focus on industry standards of data transmission and privacy in addition to optimizing device performance for real-time, high-availability applications. Students are invited to use their own departmentally approved laptop in this course; a limited number of laptops are available for use during class and lab sessions.",
