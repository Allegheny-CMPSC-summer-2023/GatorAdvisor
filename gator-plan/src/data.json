Art writers mobilize art in the service of broader cultural conversations to address social and political challenges, from race and gender equity to climate change. Students read and practice discipline-specific writing, and they also focus on interdisciplinary authors who posit art as a model of political resistance. Along with foundational writing skills, this course promotes proficiency in the visual and written language of contemporary art",

Students learn how feminist cultural producers address systemic inequalities of gender, race, and class. Recognizing that categories of gender and sexuality are constructed differently across cultures, this course takes a transnational approach. There is focus on the intersections of feminism and post-human studies and the impact of new technology and climate on contemporary feminism, queer theory, and their art.",

As citizens, we must confront choices that affect not only our own lives, but the lives of others. How we approach these choices is therefore consequential. We must consider what we owe others and what others owe us in return. We must also consider how we can develop our ability to make choices wisely. In this course, we engage in these considerations by examining rival perspectives on human nature, citizenship, and the ethical uses of political power.",

Behavioral economics considers the ways that people are more social, more impulsive, less adept at using information, and more susceptible to biases than the standard economic models assume. The course gives an overview of key insights from behavioral science and identifies ways in which these findings have been used to advance policies on education, health, energy, taxation, and more. A major goal is to understand how predictions of economic models change when phenomena such as altruism, loss aversion, and self-control problems are considered. Classroom games and experiments will be used to explain observed behaviors, in addition to standard and behavioral models..",

Topics include, but are not limited to, simple effect tests for interactions, False Discovery Rate, linear and polynomial regression analyses, coding for multicategorical predictor variables, and mediation (simple, parallel, and serial) and moderation. In addition, we will compare and contrast Frequentist and Bayesian inference and learn how to conduct basic Bayesian analyses. The course emphasizes close readings of peer reviewed publications and analyzing and reporting data using the JASP statistical package. This course is recommended for students interested in going to graduate school for psychology/other research disciplines or for those who wish to go into careers doing data analytics or research.",

Topics include, but are not limited to, simple effect tests for interactions, False Discovery Rate, linear and polynomial regression analyses, coding for multicategorical predictor variables, and mediation (simple, parallel, and serial) and moderation. In addition, we will compare and contrast Frequentist and Bayesian inference and learn how to conduct basic Bayesian analyses. The course emphasizes close readings of peer reviewed publications and analyzing and reporting data using the JASP statistical package. This course is recommended for students interested in going to graduate school for psychology/other research disciplines or for those who wish to go into careers doing data analytics or research. ",

        "courseDescription": "An introduction to behavioral economics, which uses insights from psychology, political science, anthropology, management and experimental data to improve understanding of traditional economic models of behavior. Behavioral economics considers the ways that people are more social, more impulsive, less adept at using information, and more susceptible to biases than the standard economic models assume. The course gives an overview of key insights from behavioral science and identifies ways in which these findings have been used to advance policies on education, health, energy, taxation, and more. A major goal is to understand how predictions of economic models change when phenomena such as altruism, loss aversion, and self-control problems are considered. Classroom games and experiments will be used to explain observed behaviors, in addition to standard and behavioral models.",
