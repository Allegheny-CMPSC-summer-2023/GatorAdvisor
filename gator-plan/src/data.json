      "courseDescription": "A study of the design and implementation of autonomous software agents and robotic systems that cooperatively complete complex tasks. In addition to examining techniques for large-scale coordination and group-based decision-making, students learn how to apply the field's technologies to address the challenges facing local and global communities. Participating in hands-on activities that often require teamwork, students develop and evaluate several multi-agent or multi-robot systems, while also reflecting on the civic issues surrounding the use of these systems. During a weekly laboratory session students use state-of-the-art technology to complete projects, reporting on their results through both written documents and oral presentations. Students are invited to use their own departmentally approved laptop in this course; a limited number of laptops are available for use during class and lab sessions.",

Art writers mobilize art in the service of broader cultural conversations to address social and political challenges, from race and gender equity to climate change. Students read and practice discipline-specific writing, and they also focus on interdisciplinary authors who posit art as a model of political resistance. Along with foundational writing skills, this course promotes proficiency in the visual and written language of contemporary art",

Visual culture encompasses academic Art History, but also popular spaces of representation including film, music, and television. Students learn how feminist cultural producers address systemic inequalities of gender, race, and class. Recognizing that categories of gender and sexuality are constructed differently across cultures, this course takes a transnational approach. There is focus on the intersections of feminism and post-human studies and the impact of new technology and climate on contemporary feminism, queer theory, and their art.",
